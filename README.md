this projects was completed as part of The Odin Project course

at the moment it's just a stepping stone in my studying journey but I intend to return to this at a later point and make it into a more complete portfolio-worthy project

potentially i plan to add the following:
1) sound effects
2) possibility to re-order items in the list
3) possibility to add/delete entries using the keyboard
4) counter/possibility to unlock it (so that users will be able to submit more than 7 entries)
5) customizable colors
6) improved page design
